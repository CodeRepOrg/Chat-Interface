[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-demo)

### In this sample application, you're engaging with a banking virtual assistant. The assistant simulates a few scenarios, such as making a credit card payment, booking an appointment with a banker and choosing a credit card. Watson can understand your entries and respond accordingly.


This app demonstrates the Watson Assistant service via a complete, complex interface which engages in simulated banking tasks. It utilises features such as:

 * Cloud Functions
 * Actions and UI Actions
 * Slots
 * Multi-Conditional Responses
 * Multi-Modal Responses

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
1. Download the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview).
1. Create an instance of the Watson Assistant service and get your credentials:
    - Go to the [Watson Assistant][service_url] page in the IBM Cloud Catalog.
    - Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
    - Click **Create**.
    - Click **Show** to view the service credentials.
    - Copy the `apikey` value.
    - Copy the `url` value.

## Configuring the application

1. In your IBM Cloud console, open the Watson Assistant service instance

1. Click the **Import workspace** icon in the Watson Assistant service tool. Specify the location of the workspace JSON file in your local copy of the app project:

    `<project_root>/training/banking_workspace.json`

1. Select **Everything (Intents, Entities, and Dialog)** and then click **Import**. The car dashboard workspace is created.

1. Click the menu icon in the upper-right corner of the workspace tile, and then select **View details**.

1. Click the ![Copy](readme_images/copy_icon.png) icon to copy the workspace ID to the clipboard.

    ![Steps to get credentials](readme_images/assistant-demo.gif)

1. In the application folder, copy the *.env.example* file and create a file called *.env*

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. Open the *.env* file and add the service credentials that you obtained in the previous step.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `apikey` and `url` for a Watson Assistant service instance hosted in the US East region:

    ```
    ASSISTANT_IAM_APIKEY=X4rbi8vwZmKpXfowaS3GAsA7vdy17Qh7km5D6EzKLHL2
    ASSISTANT_URL=https://gateway-wdc.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api
    ```

1. Add the `ASSISTANT_ID` to the previous properties

    ```
    ASSISTANT_ID=522be-7b41-ab44-dec3-g1eab2ha73c6
    ```

## Running locally

1. Install the dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Run the application

    ```
    npm start
    ```

1. View the application in a browser at `localhost:3000`

## Deploying to IBM Cloud as a Cloud Foundry Application

1. Login to IBM Cloud with the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-ibmcloud-cli#overview)

    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```

1. Target a Cloud Foundry organization and space.

    ```
    ibmcloud target --cf
    ```

1. Edit the *manifest.yml* file. Change the **name** field to something unique.  
  For example, `- name: my-app-name`.
1. Deploy the application

    ```
    ibmcloud app push
    ```

1. View the application online at the app URL.  
For example: https://my-app-name.mybluemix.net
